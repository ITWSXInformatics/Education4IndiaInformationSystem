       EducationForIndia is an information system desgined to distribute information to the general public, technology companies, non-profit organizations, and governments around the world in order to bring attention to the impact that COVID-19 and lack of technology has had on students ability to pursue E-learning in India.  In India, there are three main types of schools: government funded schools, schools aided by government funds, and private schools. We chose to focus on government funded schools since aided schools and private schools are able to access external resources to make sure their students have proper tools for education.  This website is simply a tool for you to view internet usage and literacy data for each state as well as number of government schools, and population. Our aim in presenting this information is to inform, educate, as well as compel you to research government schools in states that are in need and provide technology equipment and donations to them.   We are not responsible for the distribution of electronics to these schools or collecting donations for them.
